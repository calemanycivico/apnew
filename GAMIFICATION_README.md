# Gamification System for Especialidades App

This document outlines the gamification system implemented in the Especialidades App to improve user engagement and motivation.

## Features Implemented

1. **Connection Pool Improvements**
   - All database connections now use SQLAlchemy's connection pooling
   - Implemented connection retries, timeouts, and validity checks
   - Added optimal connection parameters to handle concurrent users
   - Cached connections have a time-to-live (TTL) to prevent stale connections

2. **User Levels & Experience Points**
   - Users earn XP for:
     - Answering questions correctly (5 XP in practice mode)
     - Completing exams (10-50 XP based on score)
     - Maintaining daily streaks (5 XP per day)
     - Earning achievements (10-100 XP per achievement)
   - Levels from 1 to 6 with increasing XP requirements
   - Ranks still maintained (Iniciado, Padawan, Maestro, Parra) but tied to levels

3. **Streaks System**
   - Tracks consecutive days of app usage
   - Visual streak counter with flame icons
   - Special achievements for milestone streaks (3, 7, 30 days)

4. **Achievements System**
   - Unlockable achievements for specific milestones
   - Each achievement awards XP and displays a unique icon
   - Examples: "First Steps", "Perfect Exam", "Knowledge Master"

5. **Leaderboard**
   - Shows top users based on level and XP
   - Encourages friendly competition

## Database Changes

The following database changes have been implemented:

1. **New Columns in Dim_Users Tables**
   - `xp` - Experience points
   - `level` - Current user level
   - `streak_days` - Consecutive days of activity
   - `last_active` - Timestamp of last activity

2. **New Tables**
   - `Fact_XP_History` - Records all XP gains
   - `Dim_Achievements` - Stores available achievements
   - `Fact_User_Achievements` - Tracks earned achievements

3. **Stored Procedures**
   - `sp_RecordAnswer` - Improved answer recording with retries and XP awards
   - `sp_RecordSQLAnswer` - Similar for SQL specialization

## Implementation Notes

This gamification system works with both the standard certification tracks and SQL exercises. It integrates with the existing progress tracking without requiring changes to user workflows.

## Setup Instructions

1. Run the SQL updates script to create necessary database objects:
   ```sql
   -- From SQL management studio or similar tool
   EXEC [esnowflake].[dbo].sp_executesql @stmt=N'<contents of sql_updates.sql>';
   ```

2. No app restart required - the changes are compatible with the existing codebase

## Usage

- Gamification features appear in a new tab on the Progress page
- Users can see their level, XP, achievements, and streak
- The system works automatically in the background

## Extending the System

To add new achievements or modify XP rewards:
1. Add new entries to the `Dim_Achievements` table
2. Modify the XP values in the `add_experience` function in `helper.py`
3. Add achievement award logic to relevant functions
