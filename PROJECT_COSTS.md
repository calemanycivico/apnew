## Notes

1. Development costs assume the implementation of the features described in the project review.
2. Maintenance costs will vary based on how actively the application is used.
3. Infrastructure costs are estimates and would depend on actual resource usage.
4. These estimates don't include costs for additional features beyond those specified in the review.
5. OpenAI API costs may vary depending on usage (est. $20-100/month for typical application usage).
6. Pinecone costs will depend on vector database size and query volume (est. $20-80/month).
